    descriptionFull: 'This project focuses on the analysis of njRAT v0.6.4, a well-known Remote Access Trojan (RAT), using a secure and isolated virtual lab environment (FlareVM and Remnux). Both static and dynamic analysis techniques were employed to investigate the malware’s behavior—how it infects a system, connects to its Command and Control (C2) server, and performs actions like keylogging, webcam access, and remote desktop control. The project also includes reverse engineering of the malware’s code to reveal its command structure and string encryption mechanisms. The objective is to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), develop a remediation plan, and enhance understanding of real-world threats for educational and research purposes.',
